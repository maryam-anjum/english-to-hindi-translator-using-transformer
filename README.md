English to Hindi Translator Using Transformer
Overview
This project demonstrates the use of a Transformer-based model for translating text from English to Hindi. It leverages the Huggingface Transformers library to build, fine-tune, and test a machine translation model.

Key Features
Transformer Architecture: Uses the powerful Transformer model for language translation.
Pre-trained Model: Utilizes a pre-trained model from Huggingface to ensure high accuracy and faster training.
Custom Tokenization: Implements tokenization of English input sentences and decoding of Hindi output using AutoTokenizer.
TensorFlow Integration: The project leverages TensorFlow for working with the transformer models in tf_model/.
Dataset
The model can be fine-tuned or used directly on English-Hindi sentence pairs. Preprocessing involves tokenizing the input (English) and target (Hindi) texts for training or inference.

Model Training
Training can be performed using the following steps:

Load a bilingual dataset with English-Hindi sentence pairs.
Preprocess the data using tokenizers.
Fine-tune the model using standard training techniques like supervised learning.
Limitations
The performance of the translation depends heavily on the quality of the dataset and the pre-trained model used.
More fine-tuning might be required for domain-specific translations.
